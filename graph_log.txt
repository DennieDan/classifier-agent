1. The HS-Code for Modular solar-powered IoT sensors for agricultural moisture tracking could potentially fall under Chapter 85, specifically under Note 3 which covers 'static converters' and 'monitors'. Considering the specific application of agricultural moisture tracking, the classification details may align with this category.

2. Another potential classification could be under Chapter 90, which covers optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories. Given that the IoT sensors are used for agricultural moisture tracking, they could be classified under this chapter.

3. Additionally, the sensors could also be classified under Chapter 84, which includes machinery and mechanical appliances; electrical equipment; parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers; television image and sound recorders and reproducers, parts and accessories of such articles. The IoT ---
