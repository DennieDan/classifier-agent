--- [Supervisor] Feedback/Reasoning: The user is asking for the HS-Code of high-grade industrial polymers for medical 3D printing. To find the correct HS-Code, we need to search for the relevant code in the Harmonized System. The search agent should check the chapters related to plastics and polymers, specifically looking for codes related to medical devices or 3D printing materials. The next step is to search for the correct HS-Code using the search agent. ---

--- [Supervisor] Feedback/Reasoning: The user input is 'Electric vehicle charging station with integrated advertising LED display'. To determine the correct HS-Code, we need to analyze the primary functionality of the item. The primary functionality is 'electric vehicle charging station'. However, the integrated advertising LED display may affect the classification. We need to check the Harmonized System (HS) codes for electric vehicle charging stations and advertising displays to determine the correct classification. Next, we should search for HS codes related to 'electric vehicle charging stations' and 'advertising displays' to find the most relevant code. ---

2026-02-12 16:08:19,983 - INFO - --- [Search Agent] Result: The HS-Code for Electric vehicle charging station with integrated advertising LED display is 8504.40. This classification is based on the primary functionality of the item, which is an electric vehicle charging station. The integrated advertising LED display is considered a secondary function and does not change the primary classification. The HS code 8504.40 covers electric vehicles charging stations, and the additional feature of the advertising display does not alter the classification under this code. However, it's essential to note that the classification may vary depending on the specific design and functionality of the item. Other possible classifications could be 8528.59, which covers other electronic display devices, but this would not be the primary classification for the item in question.... ---
