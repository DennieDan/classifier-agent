--- [Search Agent] Final Answer: Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific HS-Code for "Radiator panels" based on the given context information.

However, I can suggest that the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Nomenclature (HS) has a hierarchical structure consisting of six digits, with each digit representing a level of specificity. 

To find the HS-code, you may need to consult the relevant documentation or classification tables that categorize goods into specific categories based on their characteristics.

Here's an example of how the classification might look like for "Radiator panels":

HS-Code: 7321.90 (or possibly other codes depending on further specification)
Classification details:
	* Chapter 73: Articles of iron or steel
		+ Heading 7321: Radiators and spaces heaters, including thermostats, not capable of being dissociated

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and the actual HS-code may differ based on the specific characteristics and classification rules applied to "Radiator panels" in the AHTN 2022. ---

--- [Search Agent] Final Answer: After conducting a recursive search using alternative product names, broader category terms, and technical synonyms, I found a potential HS-code match for "Radiator panels".

The closest classification seems to be in the section related to "Radiators" and "Heating equipment". Specifically:

**8516.60.90 - Other NMB (Numerical Brackets)**

This subheading refers to other electro-thermic appliances, which could potentially include radiator panels as a component or a part of a larger heating system.

However, it's essential to note that the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is a complex classification system, and more precise information may be required to determine the exact HS-code for "Radiator panels".

Considering the provided guidance, I recommend further investigation into this subheading and its potential subclasses or related categories. ---

--- [Search Agent] Final Answer: After a recursive search using various techniques, I found a potential match for "Radiator panels" in the provided context.

A possible classification is:

* Heading 84.51 (Machinery for the heat-treatment of textile yarns, fabrics or made up textile articles) does not cover this product
* However, I found that Chapter 84 (Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof) has a specific note regarding radiators.
* In Note 1 to Chapter 84, it's mentioned that "Radiators for the articles of Section XVII" are excluded from classification. 
* Given this information, I looked for alternative classifications within the same chapter.

A possible match is:

* Heading 8418 (Parts suitable for use solely or principally with machine-tools of heading 84.56 to 84.65)

However, this does not seem to be a direct match for "Radiator panels". 

Upon further examination, I found that radiators are often classified under Chapter 73 (Articles of iron or steel), particularly in the context of heating and cooling systems.

A potential HS-Code match is:

* Heading 7308 (Radiators and space heaters, not electric, and parts thereof)

This classification fits within the broader category of machinery and mechanical appliances. The code may also encompass radiator panels as a component part.

Please note that this is the best match I could find using the provided context and recursive search techniques. However, without more specific product information or technical specifications, it's challenging to determine a precise HS-Code classification for "Radiator panels". ---
